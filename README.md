# SQL EMPLOYEE TRACKER

## Description

This is an app that provides an easy-to-navigate interface in the terminal that allows the user to access and manipulate a database of employee information for a company. This database, named company_db for clarity's sake, is comprised of three tables:  employee, role, and deparment.  The purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of database creation and manipulation using MySQL, and to get more experience using inquirer.  The SQL queries proved to be a challenge, but database management on a whole was an extremely interesting and engaging topic.
